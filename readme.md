### Learning TDD by applying it and hopefully acquiring some Go on the fly

imho, a developer should have three things above all:

- creativity
- blocks to build with
- know-how (to build stuff)

I consider myself to be reasonably creative.

By now I think I have enough experience in a programming language to say that I am in possession of solid, different elements to be able to build a lot of things with it.

So at the moment I'm mainly concerned with the "how?" and that's where I came across the book:
**"Learning Test-Driven Development -A Polyglot Guide to Writing Uncluttered Code"**
_by Saleem Siddiqui_

The blurb appealed to me, as did the structure after a first skim. I also like to take the opportunity to get to know "Go" and to expand and consolidate my knowledge of JavaScript.
